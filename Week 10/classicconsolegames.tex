\section{Introduction}
Classic console games.  When I hear this term, it brings back memories of sitting in front of a tube TV with my Super Nintendo Entertainment System, playing such classics as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, and Chrono Trigger, to name but a few.

A few examples of what are now considered classic video game consoles can be found in Figure \ref{fig1}.

To be perfectly honest, I have rarely had quite as much fun with the games of today as I did back then.  Why is this?  Modern games certainly look prettier.  They are also way more technologically advanced.  So again, why is this?
