                          Welcome to cs03.cs.iusb.edu!

All workstations are patched and rebooted on a tentative maintenance schedule
taking place on the Friday morning of every week.  Manage your time wisely and
make arrangments for this activity.  Performance IS impacted during this time.

                             !!!  DISCLAIMERS  !!!

Hosts cs01 through cs10 are designated solely for SSH-2 remote access, and will
be rebooted for maintenance and emergency purposes ONLY, by the SysAdmin!

Remotely log-in to any OTHER CS Lab Workstation AT YOUR OWN RISK!
