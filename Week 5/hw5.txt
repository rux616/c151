                          Welcome to cs03.cs.iusb.edu!

All workstations are patched and rebooted on a tentative maintenance schedule
taking place on the Friday morning of every week.  Manage your time wisely and
make arrangments for this activity.  Performance IS impacted during this time.

                             !!!  DISCLAIMERS  !!!

Hosts cs01 through cs10 are designated solely for SSH-2 remote access, and will
be rebooted for maintenance and emergency purposes ONLY, by the SysAdmin!

Remotely log-in to any OTHER CS Lab Workstation AT YOUR OWN RISK!

                                      ---

                         ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR OWN DATA!

Neither Indiana University nor the IUSB Department of Computer Science are
responsible for the state or storage of your files and data.  If this is unclear
to you, ask your friendly neighborhood SysAdmin (in Northside 203) to clarify.

Exercise 2
----------
1) This command compiles the file "abdce.c" into an object file and includes the path to some header files in /usr/include/mp3-2.1.  The file "abdce.o" will be the result.
2) The second command links the object files "abcde.o", "codec.o", and "sound.o" into an executable file.  The l and L options specify other libraries to be linked.  The executable file "abcde" will result.
